- 👋 Hi, I’m @cpythonist.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, C, and C++.
- 🐍 I have a good amount of experience of Python, how it works and what it does.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing a command-line interpreter (similar to cmd.exe and Bash) and writing a compiler for a new programming language (tentative name is 'Viper') in Python.
- 📫 ~Don't reach me unless you are known to me~ Nah, just reach me if you want to collaborate.
